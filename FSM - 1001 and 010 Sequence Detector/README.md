# 1001 & 010 Sequence Detector

This design represents a sequence detector capable of identifying two overlapping sequences: 1001 and 010. The implementation is achieved through the use of a Finite State Machine (FSM).

## Finite State Machine (FSM) for the Design

The FSM for this sequence detector is structured to efficiently recognize and handle the overlapping sequences 1001 and 010. The design employs a state-based approach to accurately detect the specified sequences and manage the transitions between states.
