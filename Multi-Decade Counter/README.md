# Multi-Decade Counter

This repository contains code for a Multi-Decade Counter implemented using a Binary Coded Decimal (BCD) counter module.
The counter is designed to handle counting across multiple decades, providing a solution for applications requiring extensive counting capabilities.

## Features:
- **BCD Counter Module:** The implementation leverages a BCD counter module for efficient and accurate counting.
- **Multi-Decade Capability:** The counter can seamlessly traverse multiple decades, accommodating a wide range of counting scenarios.
- **Testbench1:** A comprehensive testbench is included to ensure the functionality and reliability of the multi-decade counter in various scenarios.
- **Testbench2:** An additional testbench that tests a cascade og two multi-decade counters is implemented also.
Integrate this multi-Decade counter into your projects for robust and scalable counting operations.
