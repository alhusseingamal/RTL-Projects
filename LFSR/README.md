# Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR)

## This repo implements a generic n-bit LFSR.  
### LFSRs are used in many applications:
  #### - Pseudorandom number generation
  #### - Error Detection and Correction
  #### - Counters

### LFSRs are cheap to implement and fast enough for many applications.
