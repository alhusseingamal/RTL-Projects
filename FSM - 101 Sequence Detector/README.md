# 101 Sequence Detector with Moore and Mealy FSMs

This GitHub repository houses code for a versatile 101 sequence detector implemented using both Moore and Mealy Finite State Machines (FSMs).

## Moore FSM Implementation
The Moore FSM-based sequence detector efficiently identifies occurrences of the 101 sequence. The design utilizes states to capture the sequence and control transitions, offering a clear and organized approach to sequence detection.

## Mealy FSM Implementation
In addition to the Moore FSM, this repository provides an alternative implementation using a Mealy FSM. The Mealy machine responds to input changes, offering a dynamic approach to 101 sequence detection.

Explore the code within the sub-repository to understand and integrate these implementations, providing flexibility in choosing between Moore and Mealy FSMs for your specific sequence detection needs.
